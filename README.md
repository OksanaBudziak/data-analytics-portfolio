## Project 1 — Health Determinants Regression Analysis

### Overview
Statistical analysis of self-rated health across 500 Swedish survey respondents. 
The goal was to identify which socioeconomic and demographic factors predict 
health outcomes using OLS regression modelling.

### Methods
- Linear OLS regression (5 predictors)
- Quadratic age term to capture non-linear effects
- Log transformation of income (diminishing returns)
- Marginal effect calculation at age 40
- Residual analysis and model comparison

### Key Findings
- Age is the strongest negative predictor of health (p < 0.001)
- Health decline slows at older ages — marginal effect at 40: **-0.031**
- Doubling income associated with +0.31 points in health (p = 0.002)
- Education significant across all models (p < 0.05)
- Gender and marital status not significant

### Tools
Python | pandas | statsmodels | matplotlib | seaborn | Jupyter Notebook
